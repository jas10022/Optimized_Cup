# Optimized_Cup

This is a project where I have created the optimized cup. What does the optimized cup mean? 
Essentialy it is a cup that has the daily fluid ounces required amongs your 3 meals. 
This cup has a hollow handel as well that fits together with the cup. take a look at the project_report for more detail.
Also there is a cup.mp4 file with a blender rendering of the optimized cup for visualization.
